(a) The object I made myself is a spin of the 4 sided pyramid but I made one 
side square like the bottom and the top is a triangle because it connects the tip 
of the pyramid with the two top points of the square side face.

(c) World axes are turned off at the start.

I positioned the starting point for the camera diagonal and a little up from the "sun" 
so that when you start the program and you press space you'll be able to see all of the world axes.

You must type 
java -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false solarsystem.Starter
into the command prompt, 
if you copy and paste from pdf to command prompt it doesn't work right.
